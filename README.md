# Hack UPC Project

## Team members:

- Monika Dziedzic
- Marco Carega
- Nitish Arya
- Pablo Galván Calderón.

## Requirements:

- install Java 11
- install Dart

## How to run:

- run frontend written in Dart
- if you cannot run both frontend and backend on the same computer, you can expose e.g., backend services through
  ngrok: `ngrok http 8080` and then call the freshly-obtained URL from the frontend level.

## Show db connection:

- Go to http://localhost:8080/h2-console/
- JDBC URL: `jdbc:h2:mem:testdb`
